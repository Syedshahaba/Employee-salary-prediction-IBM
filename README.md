# Employee-salary-prediction-IBM
🧠 Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the salary of an employee based on features such as years of experience, test score, and interview score. It compares two machine learning models — Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) — to find the best predictor.



📁 Project Structure

- `employee_salary_prediction.ipynb` – Main notebook with preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization.
- `data.csv` – Dataset containing employee details and their corresponding salaries.
- `README.md` – Project documentation.



🎯 Problem Statement

- Companies often struggle with salary estimations.
- Manual predictions are biased and inconsistent.
- This project aims to use ML to build a predictive salary model.



🛠️ System Requirements

- Python 3.10+  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  
- Internet connection (for Colab)  

📦 Libraries Used

``'bash
pandas  
numpy  
matplotlib  
seaborn  
scikit-learn




🗄️Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following features:
YearsExperience: Total years of experience of the employee
TestScore: Score obtained in a technical test
InterviewScore: HR/interviewer’s score
Salary: Target variable (employee's salary)





🧪 Models Implemented

1. Linear Regression

Captures the linear relationship between features and salary.


2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

A non-parametric model that predicts salary based on nearby data points.


✅ Best Model:

Linear Regression outperformed KNN in terms of R² Score and consistency.




🚀 Deployment Possibility

The model can be deployed using Flask or Streamlit.

Further enhancement includes a web-based form to take user input and display predicted salary.



🔮 Future Scope

Include additional features like education level, job title, location.

Explore more advanced ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost).

Improve accuracy with a larger dataset.

Real-time deployment with user interface integration.
